# Drone-Room-Number-Detection
I initiated this project during my Electro-Mechanical System Design and Practics course, where I developed a drone capable of live room number tracking using the K-nearest neighbor algorithm. This project later evolved into my first conference paper, where I enhanced the system with a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for improved performance.
